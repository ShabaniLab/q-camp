# Projects

Here is a list of projects you can choose from. You can come up with your own project as well if you think you can solve a problem more efficiently on a quantum computer compared to a classical one. 

* [Quantum Key Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution): is a quantum algorithm that could be used for secure communication between two parties (Alice and Bob) where there is a third party (Charlie) evesdropping on the messages.  
[qiskit example](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/quantum-key-distribution.html)  
* Quantum Money: is based on the *[no cloning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem)* theorem which allows one to produce non-forgeable documents such as bills or id's.  
[Shor's slides](https://simons.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/docs/15601/qmoney-berkeley.pdf)   
* Variational Quantum Eigensolver: is a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm that could be used for optimization problems where you want to find the minimum or maximum of a function. It has broad applications in quantum computing since several combinatorial problems (e.g. graph partitioning) as well as physics problems (i.e. finding the lowest energy level of a system) can be solved using this algorithm.

# What to do

- read about the problem on its wiki page, 
- implement the solution using classical computation (e.g. in `python`)
- go through the `qiskit` example 
- implement the quantum solution (i.e. in `qiskit`)
- analyze how different the classical and quantum solutions are (e.g. in terms of the probability of success, complexity of the problem, and etc)
- prepare a presentation (written doc or jupyter notebook)
